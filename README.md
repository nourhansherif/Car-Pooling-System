# Car-Pooling-System
It is a mini project written in JAVA Language and all Object-Oriented Programming Concepts are applied in the implementation.

Car Pooling System helps to manage cars scheduling and bookings.

• This Car Pooling System starts by searching car routes to book them.
• A route has a start assembly location (address) and a destination location (address).
• A car has a unique code, number of trips per day, a unique route, a maximum capacity per trip, and the driver name.
• A ticket has the car code and price.

• Passengers are divided into two categories:
 - Subscribers: take a 50% discount on ticket price.
 - Non-Subscribers

• Passengers can do the following functionalities:
 - Search for routes.
 - Reserve a ticket in a car if available.
 - Subscribe a frequent passenger (the subscription fees depend on passenger age,
 and the number of trips to be reserved). 
 - Unsubscribe a frequent passenger. 
 - Report Complaint/Review.
